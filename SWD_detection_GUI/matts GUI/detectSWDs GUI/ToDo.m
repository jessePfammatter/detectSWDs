To Do:

1) Update defaults so that MOTIONFLAG is set to the appropriate channel to avoid crash.
2) Figure out whether signalMat and eegData are truly redundant, and fix to avoid duplicating huge data arrays.
3) Move default paths from Detect_SWDs_Callback to an appropriate place so that hardcoded defaults are not deeply hidden in the code.


% Try running detect SWDs through GUI. generateSWDPredictors may work now.

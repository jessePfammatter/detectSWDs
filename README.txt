README file for detectSWDs repository
--

This repository contains original code written by Jesse A. Pfammatter and Mathew V. Jones for the detection of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in mice with the gamma2R43Q mouse model of absence epilepsy. Additionally, this repository contains dependencies required to run the algorithm for the detection of SWDs, many of which were written by JP and MJ but some which were written by other authors and which are publicly available on Matlab central or other repositories.

Code in this repository is free to use or manipulate but comes without any guarantee (see LISCENSE in repository). 

**Currently, this repository and the code within are in BETA mode and thus the code may not function properly. A complete working version of this code is expected by May 2018.**

Please direct any comments or questions to Jesse Pfammatter (pfammatter@wisc.edu).
